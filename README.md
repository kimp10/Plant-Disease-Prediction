# Plant Disease Prediction using CNN and Streamlit

This project aims to predict plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and visualize the results via a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit. The model is designed to analyze images of plant leaves, classify them, and provide predictions about potential diseases, helping farmers, researchers, and agricultural experts make informed decisions for crop management.

## Key Features:
- **CNN Model for Plant Disease Classification**: Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases based on leaf images.
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: A simple and interactive web application where users can upload images of plant leaves and get instant predictions on whether the plant is diseased, along with details on the specific disease.
- **Multi-Plant Support**: Supports multiple plant species and their corresponding diseases, making it versatile for a wide range of applications in agriculture.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes preprocessing of plant leaf images (resizing, normalization, etc.) to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Provides an evaluation of the model's accuracy and performance, ensuring reliable predictions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Main programming language used for developing the CNN model and Streamlit app.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Framework used to build and train the Convolutional Neural Network.
- **Streamlit**: A Python-based framework for creating the web interface to interact with the model.
- **OpenCV / PIL**: Libraries used for image processing tasks like resizing and normalization.
- **NumPy / Pandas**: Libraries used for data manipulation and analysis.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Run the Streamlit app:


## How to Use:
- Upload an image of a plant leaf to the Streamlit app.
- The model will analyze the image and predict the plant disease.
- View the predicted disease category and confidence score.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Mobile App Integration**: Developing a mobile application for easier access to the plant disease prediction tool.
- **Expanded Dataset**: Include more plant species and diseases to enhance model accuracy and robustness.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement real-time disease prediction using video feeds or camera integration.
